# Twitter Analytics

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/alctraining/SAFe%20Initiative/_apis/build/status/pcolmer99.Twitter_Analytics2?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/alctraining/SAFe%20Initiative/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master)

Hi Readers,

My name is Paul Colmer. This R code will take your Twitter Analytics CSV file as an input.  If you are using this code unchanged,
you will need to change the filename to: 'tweet_activity_metrics_MusicComposer1.csv'.  Based on simple weightings, the code calculates
a 'Colmer' score.  This score measures the effectiveness of your tweets.  

The file is then sorted, with the most effective tweets at the top and the least effective tweets at the bottom.  The output file is called: 'Updated_TwitterAnalytics_MusicComposer1.csv'

You will also need to change the working drive to something that suits you, using the setwd() command.

If you find this valuable, please follow me on Twitter @MusicComposer1

Enjoy
